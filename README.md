## Spollnet
The SpollNet voting system offers a modern and accessible platform that allows students to participate in voting processes easily and securely. With an intuitive and friendly interface, students can access the platform from their mobile devices or computers and cast their votes quickly and conveniently.
One of the key features is its focus on the transparency and integrity of the voting process.

The system uses advanced security and encryption technologies to guarantee the protection of data and the legitimacy of the votes cast. Additionally, it offers tracking features that allow students to check the status of their votes and access detailed information about the candidates and proposals in question.

## Licenses
As a project, we have decided to incorporate Creative Commons Licenses into our student voting system to ensure copyright protection and promote fair use and
open source of created resources. To achieve this, we have designed a simple and effective process to integrate these licenses into our platform.
